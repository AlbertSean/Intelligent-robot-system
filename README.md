# Abstract
This project is an automatic intelligent robot system providing argicultural and industrial solution. Our pupose is to integrate the processes from fruit cleaning to sales, including picking up from the water, drying, packing and marking. We achieve the goal through deep learning computer vision and improve the entire process by cloud monitoring.

Here is a peak of what we do:

**Entire process:**

**Special features:**

| <a>**Compare all the mangos and choose the beautiful one**</a> | <a>**Observe the situation and deal with the problem if mangos are too closed**</a> |
