# Abstract
This project is an automatic intelligent robot system providing argicultural and industrial solution. Our pupose is to integrate the processes from fruit cleaning to saling, including picking up from the water, drying, packing and marking. We achieve the goal through deep learning computer vision and improve the entire process by cloud monitoring.
